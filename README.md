## Description

This project was created to ease the problem bootcamp students face of being bombarded with notes and info with no organization. This allows students to go back and see notes that they have taken in a structured and organized way which also allows an easier and less stressful way to study. Throughout this project the following topics were covered: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
